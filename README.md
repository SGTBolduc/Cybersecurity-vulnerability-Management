# Cybersecurity Vulnerability Management

<h2>Description</h2>
7 stages of Vulnerability Management:
Discover,Proritite, Assess, Report, Remediate, Verify, Improve
<br />
<br />
Vulnerability Scanning and Remediation Using OpenVAS on an Azure VM
I utilized OpenVAS, provided by HOSSTED, to conduct both unauthenticated and credentialed vulnerability scans on a deliberately vulnerable Azure VM. To create a test environment, I disabled firewalls and installed outdated software on the VM. I deployed OpenVAS via SSH using PowerShell to access my Hossted.app URL. For the credentialed scans, the scanner used the SMB protocol to log into the vulnerable VM with provided credentials. The initial credentialed scan failed due to incorrect login credentials provided to OpenVAS. After successfully logging in, I identified various vulnerabilities.
<br />
<br />
To remediate the vulnerabilities, I systematically uninstalled outdated software, adjusted configurations, and re-enabled the firewalls. Additionally, updating Windows could have further mitigated some vulnerabilities. Follow-up scans were conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the remediation efforts. This project provided valuable insights into the processes of vulnerability management, the critical importance of precise scan configurations, and the overall security posture improvement achievable through thorough remediation actions.

OpenVAS created a new host IP with private IP address from Azure VM: <br/>

Unauthenticated scan results signifies a potential security: <br/>

<br />
Config for Cred scans in VM Remote Registry needs to be set to Automatic which allows the scanner to look for insecure configs in the Registry: <br/>

Config for Cred scans in VM Account Control Set to Never Notify: <br/>

Config for Cred scans in VM creating a Dword Registry allows the scanner to run without running as admin: <br/>

Looks like 33 with a QoD 97% Yikes! Lets see if I can remediate some of them: <br/>

Scanning with a QoD of 70% is a common default in the cybersecurity industry: <br/>

Found the SMB protocol that OpenVAS uses to log into the VM using port 445: <br/>
