# Cybersecurity Vulnerability Management

<h2>Description</h2>
Vulnerability Scanning and Remediation Using OpenVAS on an Azure VM
<br />
I utilized OpenVAS by HOSSTED to perform both unauthenticated and credentialed scans on a deliberately vulnerable Azure VM by disabling firewalls and installing outdated software. I deployed OpenVAS via SSH using PowerShell to get my URL Hossted.app, also the scanner uses the SMB protocol to log into the vulnerable VM to perform the credentialed scan with the provided credentials. The first credentialed scan failed because the correct login credentials were not provided to OpenVAS. Upon identifying vulnerabilities, I systematically remediated them by uninstalling the outdated software, reconfiguring settings, and re-enabling the firewalls. Windows could of used a update to further remediate more vulnerabilities...Follow-up scans confirmed the effectiveness of the remediation efforts. This project provided valuable insights into vulnerability management and the importance of precise scan configurations.

OpenVAS created a new host IP with private IP address from Azure VM: <br/>

Unauthenticated scan results signifies a potential security: <br/>

<br />
Config for Cred scans in VM Remote Registry needs to be set to Automatic which allows the scanner to look for insecure configs in the Registry: <br/>

Config for Cred scans in VM Account Control Set to Never Notify: <br/>

Config for Cred scans in VM creating a Dword Registry allows the scanner to run without running as admin: <br/>

Looks like 33 with a QoD 97% Yikes! Lets see if I can remediate some of them: <br/>

Scanning with a QoD of 70% is a common default in the cybersecurity industry: <br/>

Found the SMB protocol that OpenVAS uses to log into the VM using port 445: <br/>
